# C1Statistics
Note on how some of the details of the statistics of mcstas files and a re-evaluation of how many 
counts will be needed to get the C1 correction to within 0.1s.
Version 2 uses the correct Poisson statistics for the intensity randomizations and adds a line to the summary
graph that is 0.1 s below the high statistics value for C1. It is the only version worth reading.
